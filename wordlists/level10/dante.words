that

I

which
I
have
heard
of
him
in

I

as

but
said
nothing

rather,
with
feet
fixed,
he
yawned
even
as
if

assailed
him.
He
looked
at

and

the

and
their

met.
Let

which

is

To

they
responded
by
such
rules,
that
the
serpent
made
his
tail
into
a
fork,
and
the
wounded
one
drew
together
his
feet.
The
legs
and
the
very
thighs
with
them
so
stuck
together,
that
in
short
while
the
juncture
made
no
sign
that
was
apparent.
The
cleft
tail
took
on
the
shape
that
was
lost
there,
and
its
skin
became
soft,
and
that
of

saw
the
arms
draw
in
through
the
armpits,
and
the

from

rose

the
other
fell
down,
not

turning
aside
their
pitiless
lights,[1]
beneath
which
each
was
changing
his

He
who
was
erect
drew

in

the

from
the
excess
of
material
that
came
in
there,
issued
the
ears
on
the
smooth
cheeks
that
which
did
not
run
backwards
but
was
retained,
of
its
superfluity
made
a
nose
for
the
face,
and
thickened
the
lips
so
far
as
was
needful.
He
who
was
lying
down
drives
his
muzzle
forward,

draws
in
his
ears
through
his
skull,
as

itself,

closes

smoke
stops.

within

the
ardor
that
I
had
to
gain
experience
of
the
world,
and
of
the
vices
of
men,
and
of
their
valor.
But
I
put
forth
on
the
deep,
open
sea,
with
one
vessel
only,
and
with
that
little
company
by
which
I
had
not
been
deserted.
One
shore
and
the
other[1]
I
saw
as
far
as
Spain,
far
as
Morocco
and
the
island
of
Sardinia,
and
the
rest
which
that
sea
bathes
round
about.
I
and
my
companions
were
old
and
slow
when
we
came
to
that
narrow
strait
where
Hercules
set
up
his
bounds,
to
the
end
that
man
may
not
put
out
beyond.[2]
On
the

I
left
Seville,
on
the
other
already
I
had
left
Ceuta.
O
brothers,
said
I,
who
through
a
hundred
thousand
perils
have
reached
the
West,
to
this
so
little
vigil
of
your
senses
that
remains
be
ye
unwilling
to

the
experience,
following
the
sun,
of
the
world
that

Consider
ye
your
origin
ye
were
not
made
to
live
as
brutes,
but
for
pursuit
of
virtue
and
of
knowledge.
With
this
little
speech
I
made
my
companions
so
eager
for
the
road
that
hardly
afterwards
could
I
have
held
them
back.
And
turning
our
stern
to
the
morning,
with
our
oars
we
made
wings
for
the
mad
flight,
always
gaining
on
the
left

side.
The
night
saw
now
all
the
stars
of
the
other
pole,
and
ours
so
low
that
it
rose
not
forth
from
the
ocean
floor.
Five

and
as
many
quenched
was
the
light
beneath
the

since
we
had
entered
on
the

when
there
appeared
to
us
a
mountain
dim
through
the
distance,
and
it
appeared
to
me
so
high
as
I
had
not
seen
any.
We
rejoiced
thereat,
and
soon
it
turned
to
lamentation,
for
from
the
strange
land
a
whirlwind
rose,
and
struck
the
fore
part
of
the
vessel.
Three
times
it

In
July,
1288,
Ugolino
della
Gherardesca,
Count
of
Donoratico,
head
of
a
faction
of
the
Guelphs
in
Pisa,
in
order
to
deprive
Nino
of
Gallura,
head
of
the
opposing
faction,
of
the
lordship
of
the
city,
treacherously
joined
forces
with
the
Archbishop
Ruggieri
degli
Ubaldini,
head
of
the
Ghibellines,
and
drove
Nino
and
his
followers
from
the
city.
The
archbishop
thereupon
took
advantage
of
the
weakening
of
the
Guelphs
and
excited
the
populace
against
Ugolino,
charging
him
with
having
for
a
bribe
restored
to
Florence
and
Lucca
some
of
their
towns
of
which
the
Pisans
had
made
themselves
masters.
He,
with
his
followers,
attacked
Count
Ugolino
in
his
house,
took
him
prisoner,
with
two
of
his
sons
and
two
of
his
grandsons,
and
shut
them
up
in
the
Tower
of
the
Gualandi,
where
in
the
following
March,
on
the
arrival
of
Count
Guido
da
Montefeltro
(see
Canto
xvii),
as
Captain
of
Pisa,
they
were
starved
to
death.
